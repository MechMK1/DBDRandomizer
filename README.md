# Dead By Daylight Randomizer
Pick random killers, survivors, perks, add-ons and offerings

# FAQ
Q: What is this?  
A: The DBD Randomizer is a web-based tool, designed to pick a random killer or survivor loadout for the game Dead by Daylight.

Q: What is Dead by Daylight?  
A: An asymmetric 4-vs-1 multiplayer game. One person plays the killer, the other four play the survivors.

Q: Why?  
A: I enjoy playing private matches with my friends, but we quickly found out that we always defaulted to the same perks and items. Perks which we deemed interesting never got into play because we'd rather "play it safe". So I made this tool to just pick random loadouts.

Q: How do I use it?  
A: Copy the contents into any webroot of a webserver that supports PHP.

Q: Why PHP?  
A: PHP is shit. I really dislike the language and I had already written a prototype in C#. I would only have needed to make a library out of it and then write a .NET Core application. However, I have never done that before and so I just spent a few hours doing everything in PHP.

Q: Will we get updates when new killers come out?  
A: I dunno. But everything is based on assets/data/data.json. It's really easy to understand and to add new perks, offerings, killers, etc...
